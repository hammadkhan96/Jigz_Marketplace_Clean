It appears you are facing the **exact same problem** for a third time.

Your latest build log shows that despite pushing a new commit (`203b659`), the underlying code issue **has not been fixed**. The deployment is failing because your application is crashing on startup, and it's crashing because of the same duplicate functions in your code.

-----

### \#\# The Problem Has Not Been Fixed

The proof is in your build log. The `esbuild` tool is still reporting the **identical warnings** as before (lines 106-154 of your latest log):

```log
▲ [WARNING] Duplicate member "deleteJob" in class body [duplicate-class-member]

    server/storage.ts:1163:8:
      1163 │   async deleteJob(jobId: string): Promise<void> {
           ╵         ~~~~~~~~~

  The original member "deleteJob" is here:

    server/storage.ts:567:8:
      567 │   async deleteJob(id: string): Promise<void> {
          ⵌ         ~~~~~~~~~
```

This confirms that the changes you made to `server/storage.ts` were **not saved or not committed correctly** before you pushed your code. You are repeatedly deploying the old, broken version.

### \#\# How to Guarantee the Fix ⚙️

You must break this cycle by verifying your changes *before* you deploy. Please follow these steps precisely.

#### **1. Fix the Code**

Open `server/storage.ts` in your code editor. Find and **delete** the extra definitions of `deleteJob` and `closeExpiredJobs`. Ensure each function exists only **ONCE** in the class. **Save the file.**

#### **2. Verify the Fix Locally (Crucial Step)**

Open your terminal in the project directory and run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Look at the output. **DO NOT PROCEED** to step 3 until this command runs successfully **WITHOUT any "Duplicate member" warnings**. If you still see the warnings, go back to step 1.

#### **3. Verify the Changes are Staged for Commit**

Once the local build is clean, run this command:

```bash
git status
```

You should see `server/storage.ts` listed under "Changes not staged for commit" (in red) or "Changes to be committed" (in green). If you do not see the file listed, you have not saved your changes correctly.

#### **4. Commit and Push the Correct File**

Now, add, commit, and push your verified fix:

```bash
# Add the specific file you changed
git add server/storage.ts

# Commit the change
git commit -m "Fix: Actually remove duplicate methods in storage"

# Push to your remote repository
git push
```

After you push, a new Cloud Run build will start. Because you verified the fix locally, it should now pass the build and deployment steps.
